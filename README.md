# ðŸŸ¢ Reasons
* You don't need to open a browser to play a song form Youtube 
* Yt-player usage less resource. When you open a browser to play a song from youtube, on average that one tab usage more then 150 MB (depending on your processor) of RAM but on the other hand Yt-Player usage only 10 to 20 MB RAM 
* It can run in background.
* Yt-Player is Free and Youtube Music or Spotify is Not!
* Youtube Music is not available in Bangladesh
